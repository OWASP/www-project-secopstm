pitch: A DevSecOps tool for generating and automating cyber-defense from Markdown threat models using Python and Ansible.

---

The purpose of SecOpsTM project is to make threat modeling an accessible, automated, and dynamic practice that can be integrated into modern DevSecOps workflows. It aims to bridge the gap between complex cybersecurity analysis and continuous software development.

> **Based on [PyTM](https://github.com/OWASP/pytm):** This framework leverages PyTM's modeling primitives and extends them with advanced reporting, MITRE mapping, and diagram generation.

Project Description
SecOpsTM is a Python-based framework for end-to-end threat modeling.  
It automates STRIDE threat identification and maps them to MITRE ATT&CK.     
Define your system using a simple Markdown DSL or import from IaC (Ansible).   
The tool generates rich HTML reports, JSON data, and visual diagrams.   
A powerful CLI enables seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines.   
The interactive web GUI allows for real-time graphical model building.   
Visualize your threat landscape with ATT&CK Navigator and Attack Flow diagrams.   
It supports custom threat rules and configurable severity calculations.   
Built on [PyTM](https://github.com/OWASP/pytm), it provides a highly extensible and developer-friendly platform.   
This framework streamlines security analysis from design to deployment
