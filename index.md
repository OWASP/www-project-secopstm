The purpose of the pytmThreatModeling project is to make threat modeling an accessible, automated, and dynamic practice that can be integrated into modern DevSecOps workflows. It aims to bridge the gap between complex cybersecurity analysis and continuous software development.

Project Description
pytmThreatModeling is a project that facilitates the creation and continuous tracking of threat models by treating them as code. It is designed to be a complementary solution to existing tools like OWASP PyTM, but with a different focus on accessibility and automation.

### Road Map
the primary goal of this phase is to officially establish the project within the OWASP ecosystem and build a strong foundation for community collaboration.

then

* Refinement of Input Parsers: We'll finalize the logic for parsing threat models from Markdown and YAML, ensuring robustness and consistency.
* Core Threat Generation: We'll implement the primary functionality for generating threat reports and lists from the parsed data.

then :

based on feedback from DevSecOps professionals, this phase will focus on making the tool highly practical. We will develop official, reusable *CI/CD pipeline templates* (for platforms like GitHub Actions and GitLab CI) that include configurable *Security Gates*. We will also create use-case-driven documentation, such as "how-to guides" for common DevSecOps workflows.

In this final phase, we will expand the project's capabilities and actively encourage community contributions. We will work to make the architecture more modular, expand the default threat library with community input, and prepare for a major *v2.0 release*. The ultimate goal is to evolve the project into a comprehensive and indispensable tool for DevSecOps teams.
